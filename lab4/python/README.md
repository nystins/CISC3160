# Python

## Choosing Python

I've decided to choose python as my second language for lab4. The reason because, python syntax to me <br/> is easy to learn, it has large libraries and toolkits, it can integrate with other languages such as C and C++. 

# EP - Euler's Problem

In euler's second problem, I was given a problem where I used one of python's data structure which is "tuple". A tuple is a immutable container. 

In line 15: a, b = b, a+b was used to re-assign a and b for the problem.

From java perspective to solve this problem a placeholder will need to be assign for a+b in order to re-assign it back to b. <br/>
In contrast to python we can create the tuple (b, a+b) and then unpack it back into a and b.
